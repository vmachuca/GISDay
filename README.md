Survivor for ArcGIS Online and iOS app (GISDay)
======

GISDay iOS Application

The search for survival part of the human condition, civilization as we organize ourselves to survive large-scale events through collaboration among survivors.

Our goal is to demonstrate through the use of ArcGIS Online is simple as creating the structure for this type of collaboration.

For this model we aim to find the places where the basic rules for survival such as water, food, shelter, medicines, other groups of survivors, disease outbreaks, weaponry ...

The idea is to survive as real threats:
- Zombie Apocalypse
- Attack of giant monsters
- Alien invasion
- End of the world in 2012

And other events not as probable as:
- Hurricanes
- Terrorist attacks
- Floods
- Volcanic Eruptions
- Earthquakes
- Tsunami
